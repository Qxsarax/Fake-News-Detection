# Fake-News-Detection

Project Background

The problem of fake news has become a significant threat in the modern world, fueled by the increasing popularity of social media and the speed at which information can travel. This phenomenon has led to widespread misinformation and has created problems in society and institutions. The US Government, aware of this challenge, has decided to take concrete action. It has commissioned your company to develop a Chrome plugin that can identify whether a news item is fake or true. The system will aim to protect users from misinformation, improving the quality of information online.

Project Goal

The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model that can detect fake news with precision. The model will be integrated into the Chrome plugin and will provide users with a real-time indication of the veracity of the news they are reading.

Added Value

The fake news detection system will have a significant impact on society, ensuring:

- Reduction of disinformation: helping users to promptly identify unreliable news.
- Improvement of trust in the media: providing advanced technological tools to combat the problem of disinformation.
- Decision support: users and institutions will be able to make decisions based on more reliable information.
